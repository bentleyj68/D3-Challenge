# D3-Challenge

This assignment looks at US trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.

Information has been obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml.

The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

A scatter graph has been developed using D3 javascript.  It allows interactions to the user to choose from various health factors.
